##SOFTWARE DESIGN AND ENGINEERING

The original artifact the I am working with is from CS-340. It was an API built in Python, using Bottle microservice framework and MongoDB as the database. The project that I am using as a starting point is a single file Python API that implements CRUD on a MongoDB database. It is a simple application and does what it intends on a very basic level.

This first category is to show my abilities in software design and engineering. I accomplished this by adapting the original application to a different framework, from bottle (the original framework, to flask, the new framework). I also made the application modular; the original application was a single file. I also included an html interface for the application. I also added security to the application by creating a login and using sessions.

I had no previous experience using Flask. I had read about it in passing and got the idea to use it here while looking into Bottle and trying look for things to add to this same project, but in reference to the database prompt. I realized that other frameworks were much more commonly used and had greater functionality and it might be interesting to learn more about them and it that I could adapt the original Bottle application to Flask. I decided that this was a good direction to go. I watched a lot of videos about Flask and read a lot of the documentation for Flask as well as documentation for other libraries that I used in the project.

I was originally planning on going in an entirely different direction with the final project and all the milestones. However, after realizing that I could meet all the requirements with this one project, I decided that would be the new direction I would take.
