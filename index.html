<p>Welcome to your first GitHub Pages website!</p>
  Professionally, I am completing my BS in CS at SNHU and hope to get into software engineering. 
  I have a pretty diverse background. I completed a software engineering internship while working 
  towards this degree. I have also done a great deal of traveling while I have been in school. 
  Currently I have been doing some IT work for a small healthcare company. I think that one of 
  the most important things that I can say about myself is that I love to figure things out and 
  learn new things. Most of my programming experience is with C#, Python, C++, Java. I also have 
  some experience with JavaScript. I have worked with MySQL, MSSQL Server, and MongoDB. As for 
  tools, I am most comfortable with MS Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, although I have 
  been learning more about, and using Eclipse IDE.  I have also been learning more about using 
  GitHub and BitBucket. I have recently decided that I would like to learn about Azure and/or 
  AWS and I have found some online classes to start learning.
